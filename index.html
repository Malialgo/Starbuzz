      <a href="mission.html" title="Read more about our mission"
        >Read about our Mission</a
      >.
      <br />
      Read the
      <a
        href="http://wickedlysmart.com/buzz"
        title="Read all about caffeine on the Buzz"
        >Caffeine Buzz</a

      So I added my own navbar after following examples from w3schools and I
      made the navbar link to my <a href="message.html">Message</a> page and my
      <a href="mission.html">Mission</a> page. I also included them the links
      here in this paragraph as well. I also used another example from w3schools
      to add a separate style sheet so that it looks a bit nicer.
